# BURGER
PURPOSE: This app is created for restaurant so that user can type in the burger they want to eat and then order it.

OVERVIEW: We have used Node JS, Express JS, MySQL, ORM and handlebars for this app. Handlebars are used to display the result on the screen. Express JS is calling all the get routes to add the burger name and to show it on screen. MySQL has been used to store database of the burger. We have also used ORM to create different methods to call when required.

HOW TO USE: User will navigate to the app and type the burger name he wants to eat and it will keep adding the burgers. with the button called devour it. When user clicks the button devour it, it will move to the second column that containes all the devoured burgers. User cannot enter empty value to the text box.
